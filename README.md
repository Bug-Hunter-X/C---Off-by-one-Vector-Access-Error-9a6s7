This repository demonstrates a common off-by-one error in C++ when iterating over a `std::vector`. The `bug.cpp` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.cpp` provides a corrected version.  The error arises from attempting to access the element at index `vec.size()`, which is one element beyond the valid range (0 to `vec.size()-1`).  This leads to undefined behavior, potentially causing crashes or unexpected results. The solution corrects the loop condition to prevent accessing the out-of-bounds element.
